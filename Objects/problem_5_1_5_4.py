#Last problem, you created a new class called Force. Copy that
#class below:
class Force:
    def __init__(self, magnitude, angle):
        self.magnitude = round(magnitude, 1)
        self.angle = angle
    def get_horizontal(self):
        return self.magnitude * (cos(radians(self.angle)))
    def get_vertical(self):
        return self.magnitude * (sin(radians(self.angle)))
    def get_angle(self, use_degrees = True):
        if use_degrees == True:
            return round(degrees(self.angle),1)
        if use_degrees == False:
            return round(radians(self.angle), 1)


#In this problem, you're going to use that class to calculate
#the net force from a list of forces.
#
#Write a function called find_net_force. find_net_force should
#have one parameter: a list of instances of Force. The
#function should return new instance of Force with the total
#net magnitude and net angle as the values for its magnitude
#and angle attributes.
#
#As a reminder:
#
# - To find the magnitude of the net force, sum all the
#   horizontal components and sum all the vertical components.
#   The net force is the square root of the sum of the squares
#   of the horizontal forces and the vertical foces (i.e.
#   (total_horizontal ** 2 + total_vertical ** 2) ** 0.5)
# - To find the angle of the net force, call atan2 with two
#   arguments: the total vertical and total horizontal
#   forces (in that order).
# - Remember to round both the magnitude and direction to one
#   decimal place. This can be done using round(magnitude, 1)
#   and round(angle, 1).
# - The Force class has three methods: get_horizontal returns
#   a single force's horizontal component. get_vertical
#   returns a single force's vertical component. get_angle
#   returns a single force's angle in degrees (or in radians
#   if you call get_angle(use_degrees = False).
#
#HINT: Don't overcomplicate this. The Force class does a lot
#of your work for you. Use it! You should not need any trig
#functions except atan2, degrees, and radians.


#Add your function here!
def find_net_force(instance):
    total_horizontal = 0

        total_vertical += i.get_vertical()

    angle = atan2(total_vertical, total_horizontal)
